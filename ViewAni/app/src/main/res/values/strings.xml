    <string name="info_content">As noted above, Michael Rideout has said that he is still in possession of the chalice he won in the Fireworld competition. In 2005, he sent pictures to the gaming website Digital Press, which posted them along with an interview he gave to the website Atari Headquarters in 1999. In the course of the interview, Rideout mentioned he had heard the medallion won by Steven Bell was melted down by a coin dealer for scrap after Bell sold it for $15,000; he kept the baubles that were part of it.</string>
